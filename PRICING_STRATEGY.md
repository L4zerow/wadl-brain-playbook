# WADL Brain Pricing Strategy

## Executive Summary

**Current pricing is 40-60% below market value.**

Based on comprehensive market research, the WADL Brain methodology delivers enterprise-grade organizational intelligence systems that should command $75,000-$150,000+ for full implementations, not $25,000-$75,000.

The core issue: **Domain Capture (the hardest, most valuable work) is priced the lowest.**

---

## The Problem: Current vs. Market Reality

### Current Pricing

| Phase | Current Range | Effort (Hours) | Implied Rate |
|-------|---------------|----------------|--------------|
| Discovery | $2-5k | 20-35 | $60-250/hr |
| Domain Capture | $3-8k | 50-78 | **$40-160/hr** |
| Architecture | $2-5k | 40-68 | **$30-125/hr** |
| Build | $15-50k | 140-240 | $60-360/hr |
| **Total (1-4)** | **$25-75k** | 250-420 | $60-300/hr |
| Iterate | $2-5k/mo | 28-45/mo | $45-180/hr |

### Market Reality

| Service Type | Market Rate |
|--------------|-------------|
| AI Consulting (Senior) | $300-500/hr |
| Custom AI Development | $150-250/hr |
| Enterprise Knowledge AI Systems | $50,000-$200,000 |
| Domain Expertise Capture | $200-350/hr |
| Technical Architecture | $200-300/hr |

**The gap:** You're charging $40-160/hr for work that commands $200-350/hr in the market.

---

## Key Finding: Where Value Is Lost

### Domain Capture is Catastrophically Underpriced

This phase involves:
- 30-50 hours of domain expert interviews
- 20-40 hours extracting and documenting rules
- 10-20 hours building edge case library
- 5-10 hours validating with client

**Total: 65-120 hours of senior consultant work**

At market rates ($200-300/hr), this is worth **$13,000-$36,000**.

Current price: $3,000-$8,000. **You're leaving $10,000-$28,000 on the table per engagement.**

### Why This Matters

The Domain Spec becomes the Cortex. The Cortex IS the product. Everything else is scaffolding.

A well-captured domain makes the AI work. A poorly-captured domain makes it worthless. This is where all the value lives, but it's priced like administrative work.

## Recommended Pricing Model

### Option 1: Value-Aligned Phase Pricing (Recommended)

| Phase | New Range | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Discovery | $5,000-$10,000 | 20-35 hrs @ $250/hr |
| Domain Capture | **$15,000-$25,000** | 50-78 hrs @ $250-$320/hr |
| Architecture | **$10,000-$18,000** | 40-68 hrs @ $250-$265/hr |
| Build | $30,000-$60,000 | 140-240 hrs @ $215-$250/hr |
| **Total (1-4)** | **$60,000-$113,000** | |
| Iterate | $4,000-$8,000/mo | 28-45 hrs @ $140-$180/hr |

**Why this works:**
- Reflects actual effort and expertise required
- Aligns with market rates for comparable services
- Positions WADL as premium, not commodity
- Still delivers 5-10x ROI for clients

### Option 2: Tiered Engagement Model

**Tier 1: Foundation Brain** ($50,000-$75,000)
- Single data source
- Chat interface only
- Basic domain capture (15-20 business rules)
- Standard guardrails
- 4-6 week delivery

**Tier 2: Professional Brain** ($75,000-$120,000)
- 2-3 data sources
- Chat + basic visualizations
- Deep domain capture (40+ business rules)
- Advanced guardrails
- 8-12 week delivery

**Tier 3: Enterprise Brain** ($120,000-$200,000+)
- 4+ data sources
- Multi-channel interface (chat, dashboard, API)
- Exhaustive domain capture (100+ rules)
- Full security/compliance
- 12-16 week delivery

**Ongoing for all tiers:** $4,000-$10,000/month based on complexity

### Option 3: Value-Based Pricing (For Complex Engagements)

Price at **10-20% of quantifiable first-year value**.

**Example: Kevin Kane-type engagement**
- If system saves 500 hours/year across firm @ $300/hr effective rate
- Annual value = $150,000
- Price = $15,000-$30,000 for that component
- Total engagement with multiple value streams: $100,000-$250,000

**Example: Primula-type engagement**
- 10 directors × 90 hours saved × $40/hr = $36,000/year
- 10% of 3-year value = $10,800
- But actual value is higher (faster decisions, competitive advantage)
- Price: $50,000-$75,000 is justified

---

## Complex Engagement Pricing (Kevin Kane Model)

For engagements with multiple systems, compliance requirements, or strategic importance:

### Base + Complexity Model

**Base:** $75,000
- Standard 5-phase engagement
- Single primary use case
- One data integration
- Chat interface

**Complexity Multipliers:**

| Factor | Addition |
|--------|----------|
| Each additional data source | +$10,000-$20,000 |
| Compliance requirements (HIPAA, etc.) | +$15,000-$30,000 |
| Custom interface (dashboard, multi-channel) | +$15,000-$25,000 |
| Multiple user types with different access | +$10,000-$15,000 |
| Strategic/executive use case | +$20,000-$40,000 |

**Kevin Kane Example:**
- Base: $75,000
- Multiple data sources (case management, documents, calendar): +$40,000
- Legal compliance requirements: +$25,000
- Dashboard + chat interface: +$20,000
- Multiple user types (partners, associates, paralegals): +$15,000
- **Total: $175,000**

Plus ongoing: $6,000-$10,000/month

## Pricing Psychology Tactics

### 1. Anchor High

Always present premium option first:
- "Our Enterprise Brain starts at $150,000..."
- "For your scope, Professional Brain at $95,000 is ideal"

### 2. Paid Discovery

Charge $5,000-$10,000 for Phase 1 (Discovery) as standalone.
- Gets you paid to understand their world
- Filters serious clients
- Creates momentum for full engagement
- 5-10% of total engagement value

### 3. Present Three Options

Always give three tiers:
- Foundation ($50-75k) - "Gets the job done"
- Professional ($75-120k) - "Recommended" (anchor here)
- Enterprise ($120-200k) - "Full transformation"

### 4. Frame as Investment, Not Cost

"This $100,000 investment will save your team 2,000 hours annually. At your effective rate of $150/hour, that's $300,000 in value. You'll break even in 4 months."

### 5. Annual Value Framing

Instead of "$6,000/month ongoing," say:
"$72,000 annually for a system delivering $300,000+ in value"

---

## ROI Framework for Client Conversations

### The ROI Calculation

```
Annual Value = (Hours Saved × Hourly Value) + (Revenue Increase) + (Risk Reduction)
Price Target = Annual Value × 0.1 to 0.2 (10-20% of first year)
Or: 3-Year Value × 0.05 to 0.10 (5-10% of 3-year value)
```

### Primula ROI (Reference)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Directors using system | 10 |
| Hours saved per director/year | 90 |
| Effective hourly value | $50 |
| Annual direct savings | $45,000 |
| Decision speed improvement | 10x |
| Intangible value (competitive, retention) | $20,000+ |
| **Total annual value** | **$65,000+** |

**Justified price:** $65,000 × 1.5 years = ~$100,000 implementation
**What was charged:** $30,000-$40,000 (62-70% discount)

### Making the Case

"Based on your team size and use case, we estimate this brain will deliver $150,000 in annual value. Our implementation fee of $100,000 means you'll achieve positive ROI within 8 months, with compounding returns thereafter."

---

## Implementation: How to Raise Prices

### For New Clients

Start immediately with new pricing:
- Foundation: $60,000
- Professional: $95,000
- Enterprise: $150,000+
- Ongoing: $5,000-$8,000/month

### For Existing Clients

At renewal:
- Increase ongoing rate by 25-50%
- Frame as "value increase" not "price increase"
- Add new capabilities to justify

### Conversation Framework

"After completing several engagements, we've refined our methodology significantly. Our new pricing reflects the true value delivered—clients typically see 5-10x ROI within the first year. For your scope, the investment would be $XX."

---

## What You Should Never Say

- "Our prices are negotiable"
- "We can do it for less"
- "The hourly rate is..."
- "Compared to hiring someone full-time..."

## What You Should Always Say

- "The investment for this engagement is..."
- "Based on the value you'll receive..."
- "Our clients typically see ROI within..."
- "The annual value of this system exceeds..."

---

## Summary: The New WADL Pricing

### Minimum Engagement

**$60,000** for Foundation Brain + $4,000/month ongoing

### Standard Engagement

**$95,000** for Professional Brain + $6,000/month ongoing

### Complex/Enterprise Engagement

**$150,000+** for Enterprise Brain + $8,000-$15,000/month ongoing

### The Math

| Old Model | New Model | Difference |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| $25-75k | $60-150k+ | +140% to +100% |
| $2-5k/mo | $4-10k/mo | +100% |

**You were charging Camry prices for Mercedes delivery.** The new pricing reflects the actual value you create.
